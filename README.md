# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple, command-line Tic Tac Toe game written in Python. Players take turns to place their mark ('X' or 'O') on the grid. The first player to place three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the grid is filled up and no player has won, then the game is a tie.
